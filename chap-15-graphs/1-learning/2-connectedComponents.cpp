// connected components are basically individual disconnected portions of single graph which are not directly connected but all of these components are still part of a single graph and to traverse across them we maintain a visited array so make sure we complete traversal on all the nodes, else if traverse across a single component, our recursion would say graph is over but only that component was traversed not all the nodes
