// why do we use priority queue instead of queue

// we can also find the shortest path using queue in Dijktra algo but it would be similar to brute force as due to queue we will be checking all the paths and thus increasing the time complexity but in the priority queue we always store the min path so even if we will be exploring all the paths but we would go for minimal first and hence much much better time of ElogV

// so for all practical purposes PQ is still better than both set and queue
