// of so waht do we want exactly, if the stack is empty we dont push or pop from stack, because for valid paren each opening must have a closing and when the stack is empty we discard the opening and closing means we are indeed taking elementary decomposition of valid paren string which cant be broken again, when stack is not empty we push into the stack every opening bracket and add it to the answer and when the stack is not empty and its a closing bracket then we pop from the stack and verify if opening is available (which will always be since every string is valid paren here), we pop and add the closing bracket to answer
