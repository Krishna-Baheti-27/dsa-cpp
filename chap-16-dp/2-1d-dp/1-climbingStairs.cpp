// how to understand whether its a dp problem
// whenever the question is like count number of ways or there are multiple ways to do something and find min or max output

// so the above thing gives us idea about recursion and once we write recurrence relation then we can apply dp on it

// Shortcut to write recurrence relation
// 1) Try to represent the problem in terms of index
// 2) Do all possible stuffs on that index according to problem statement
// 3) Sum of all stuffs => count all ways
//  Min or max of all stuffs => find min

// You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
// Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
